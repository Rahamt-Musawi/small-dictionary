# small-dictionary
This is a small web-based dictionary that is developed just for fun. But still it works decent.

Vue.js and tailwind are used on the frontend.
Few Python libraries like NLTK and Beautiful Soup are used on the backend. 
Socket.io does the information exchange between backend and frontend.
