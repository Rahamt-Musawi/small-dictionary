# Small Dictionary
This is a small web-based dictionary that is developed just for fun. But still it works decent.

> Vue.js and tailwind are used on the frontend.

> Few Python libraries such as NLTK and Beautiful Soup are used on the backend. 

> Socket.io does the information exchange between backend and frontend. 


![Here is a demo video of the application](https://github.com/Rahamt-Musawi/small-dictionary/issues/1#issue-1595668990)
