# small-dictionary
This is just a very tiny dictionary project which is developed for the aim of practicing. It contains over 155000 words with their definitions, synonyms, antonyms and examples. Some other definitions and examples of the given words are also being loaded from the internet. Currently, only English to English words are supported, but other languages can be added easily in the future.

## Note
Python code on the backend should be optimized. 

> Vue.js and tailwind are used on the frontend.

> Few Python libraries such as NLTK and Beautiful Soup are used on the backend. 

> Socket.io does the information exchange between backend and frontend.
